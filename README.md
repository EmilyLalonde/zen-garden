# Dog Party 2.0!

The goal for this project was to experiment with the diverse ways in which you can style css when you have a semantic and well layed out HTML. It is also a project where the basic use of JavaScript is implimented so we can get used to using it. In this project I have completed both comps to the best of my ability while also finishing this project through phase 3 with DOM manipulation.
